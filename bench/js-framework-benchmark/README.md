# Benchmark Policy

Arrow benchmark claims must be backed by the official `js-framework-benchmark`
Arrow entries:

- `frameworks/keyed/arrowjs`
- `frameworks/non-keyed/arrowjs`

The local harness syncs Arrow's benchmark source into those official entries
and pins the benchmark dependency to the published `@arrow-js/core` version in
`packages/core/package.json`. Benchmark runs therefore reflect the real npm
release we intend to submit, not a benchmark-only adapter or an unshipped local
runtime blob.

For branch-local perf iteration, set `JS_FRAMEWORK_BENCHMARK_ARROW_MODE=local`
after running `pnpm build:runtime`. That mode copies `packages/core/dist` into
the official Arrow benchmark entry and labels the run with the local git SHA,
but it is for development-only comparisons and not for benchmark claims.

Non-negotiables:

- No manual DOM implementations presented as Arrow results.
- No benchmark-only side channels that bypass the public Arrow runtime.
- No direct DOM mutation in benchmark apps beyond what the public Arrow runtime
  does internally.
- Any optimization used in the benchmark app must be a real Arrow feature that
  users can employ in production code.

Allowed work:

- Runtime optimizations inside Arrow itself.
- Public API additions that users can actually adopt, such as memoization or
  lower-allocation event patterns.
- Benchmark app improvements only when they use public Arrow APIs and remain
  readable as normal Arrow code.
